# 8th
 Sublime Text 8th Language syntax

Syntax File
===========

* I use a custom theme with extended colors and scopes such as peach and orange. These will show as the default text color if not defined for you.  Use ctrl+shift+p or ctrl+alt+shift+p to see what the scope of the text under the carot is.

* It's easy to edit 8th.sublime-syntax and just remove these values:  For example _io.keywords.8th_ would become _keywords.8th_

* This will cause that scope to use the keywords color which is common in most themes.

* This file is not complete at this time.  I included the most common namespaces but left out others such as net, db, image, network etc.

Completions file
================

Due to the nature of 8th, there are not very many patterns that need templates. Here are the ones I've created

* repagain
* repuntil
* repwhile
* fun
* funi
* main
* ifthen
* ifelse

That's it!
